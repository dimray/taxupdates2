<p>Use this section to submit and view
    adjustments to the figures in your Cumulative Summary. There is no requirement to submit accounting adjustments
    unless you need to.</p>

<p>If an annual or quarterly update is submitted after making accounting adjustments, submitted adjustments become
    invalid and should be resubmitted.</p>

<p>If multiple adjustments are submitted, later submissions will overwrite earlier ones.</p>
