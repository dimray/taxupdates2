<p>You can use either: </p>

<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li>cash accounting (based on money received and paid out)</li>
        <li>accrual accounting (based on dates income and expenses are incurred)</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<p>The accounting type can be changed after the tax year has ended and before the Final Declaration for the
    year is submitted.</p>

<p>This business currently uses <b><?= esc($accounting_type ?? 'unknown') ?> accounting</b>, and will use
    <b><?= esc($new_accounting_type ?? 'unknown') ?> accounting</b> if you change the type.
</p>


<p>Select which tax
    year you want the change to
    take effect,
    then confirm.</p>
