<p>There is no requirement to submit an
    Annual Submission if it is not needed.</p>

<p>An Annual Submission can be made for each property or self-employment business, and adjusts the figures submitted
    through the Cumulative Summary for that business. Use the Annual Submission to:</p>

<div class="list">
    <ul>
        <li>Claim the Trading Income Allowance</li>
        <li>Claim Capital Allowances</li>
        <li>Declare Balancing Charges</li>
        <li>Make adjustments, inluding:
            <ul>
                <li>Averaging Adjustments</li>
                <li>Basis Adjustments</li>
                <li>Overlap Relief Used</li>
                <li>Change of Accounting Practice</li>
                <li>Goods and Services Taken for Own Use</li>
                <li>Non Taxable Profits</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Claim Exemption from National Insurance</li>
        <li>Declare whether Business Details have changed</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<h3>Amending A Submission</h3>

<p>To change an Annual Submission after it has been submitted, make a new submission. The new submission
    will
    overwrite the previous submission, so it is necessary to provide all figures as though no Annual Submission has
    previously been made.</p>
